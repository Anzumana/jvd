## javascript-vim-debugger 

The goal of this project is to create a great debugging experience for javascript from withing vim.  
FullStack Javascript Development from within vim should be amazing.
Hopefully we can make that happen :)

To enable chrome debugging start chrome with:
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```
